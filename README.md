## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my very first personal project, therefore, I learned a lot. My main concern before I started coding was how was I supposed to write code that was readable by me and others. I tried to put extra effort in making my code easy to read, instead of trying to use "tricks" to make it shorter or more optimized.

### Continued development

I know I still have a lot to learn and that excites me. I will continue to work on my understanding of CSS, which seems to be my weakest link right now. I want to improve my understanding of CSS Grid and Flexbox.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/) - I used this website a lot to learn how the properties that I was trying to implement work.
